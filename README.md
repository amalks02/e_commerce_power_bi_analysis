## üõçÔ∏è **Background**

In today's competitive e-commerce landscape, understanding customer preferences, purchasing behavior, and order fulfillment efficiency is paramount. As an analyst at **Digital Commerce Insights**, you are tasked with analyzing two key datasets:  

1. **Ecommerce Orders**  
   - Contains transactional data such as product details, quantities, unit prices, order dates, and shipping costs.  

2. **Customer Profiles**  
   - Includes customer demographics such as email, country, membership type, and spending history.  

By exploring these datasets, the project aims to uncover patterns and strategies to enhance the performance of Sellfy's e-commerce platform.
