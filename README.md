### **Case Study: Enhancing E-Commerce Strategies through Data Analytics**

### **Background**

As an analyst at Digital Commerce Insights, a consultancy focused on e-commerce optimization, 
you have access to two pivotal datasets: 'Ecommerce Orders' and 'Customer Profiles'. 
The 'Ecommerce Orders' dataset offers detailed insights into customer orders, including products purchased, quantities, unit prices, order dates, and shipping costs.
Meanwhile, the 'Customer Profiles' dataset provides rich information on customer demographics, such as email, country, membership type, and spending history.

In an e-commerce landscape where customer preferences, purchasing behavior, and efficient order fulfillment play crucial roles, your analytical prowess is vital. 
Your challenge is to dissect these datasets to uncover patterns and insights that could revolutionize e-commerce strategies, improve customer engagement, and drive sales growth.


### **Objective**

Your task is to harness the power of Power BI to transform these datasets into a compelling narrative. 
This will involve thorough data cleaning, effective data modeling, and strategic use of DAX for in-depth analytics. 
Your ultimate goal is to create an interactive, user-friendly dashboard that vividly displays your findings, providing actionable insights
